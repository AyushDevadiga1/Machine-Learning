1,UgyphTVZhnLinlbm3CV4AaABAg,"Me and my girlfriend love listening to Tv girl and skipping classes so we can spend time together. My parents hate her since they’re extremely homophobic and think she’s a bad influence. We’re in different classes and can barely see each other in between classes. I can’t text her because my parents made me delete her number. It’s really hard to deal with everything, I absolutely adore her. And it hurts to not be able to see her. Knowing that it’s my fault we can’t be together because of my home life and parents. I love her very much and hope when I move out we can finally get together and get married.",16,76,11 months ago,False,UCcVpKeEsb3SnCvyu0iyw-Pw,@ALMIGHTY_TALLEST_0RPLE,False
2,Ugys9ZZfLKhceBD8nmB4AaABAg,Just playing this song out loud to cover the sound of my crying at 10 PM. Had to give my poor old lady (cat) away to a new home and it's tearing me to pieces. Not to overshare in a TV Girl song YouTube comment section of all places but I had to get it out of my system because it feels like its physically eating at me. I hope everyone seeing this is doing leagues better than me currently :'),455,9,6 months ago,False,UCJCnhMB01vnIB41quBtjbYg,@sochiii7491,False

it also perfectly encapsulated the longing for a romantic relationship, but one you made up perfectly in your head. so theres just this longing for someone who isnt real to be real and love you but in reality they arent there.",28,26,1 year ago,True,UCiPPAKKtqvecTiLyCfbvmQQ,@dankacademia1865,False

7,UgxLj0c5c_5-AoP70mx4AaABAg,"The lyrics to TV Girl's song Loving Machine tell the story of a woman named Maddie Klein and her relationship with her ""loving machine"". The machine is described as being almost human but lacking the ability to fulfill certain desires and actions that a normal human partner could. Despite this, the song suggests that Maddie is content with the relationship because the machine will never leave her. The song points out the superficiality of human relationships that Maddie has experienced in the past, where men only wanted to use her for sex and then leave her alone.

However, the lyrics also reveal the limitations of the relationship. Maddie can't get the machine wet or he'll overheat and when he eventually becomes obsolete, she can simply throw him away and get a new one. These limitations show the emptiness of the relationship, as Maddie cannot truly connect with the machine on a deep emotional level. The song seems to suggest that Maddie has settled for the machine because she was tired of being used by men and enjoys having a reliable partner.

Overall, the lyrics to Loving Machine showcase the theme of human connection and the difficulties that come with it, ultimately asking the question of whether a machine can provide the same level of companionship and love as another human.",14,28,1 year ago,False,UCCRkEHQosSQ6yn2QJdKNkEg,@Rexjr58,False
